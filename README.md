A Command Line Tool to create shareable development workspaces instantly on different Linux distributions. TermShell will be a great solution to 
* Students (mainly in India) who opt for multiple system and boot partitions for running programs on different linux distributions which use less system resources.
* Developers who want an isolated and shareable workspace instantly to build and test software.
* Learn and play with software in isolated environment without effecting the host.
